# cs50-music

Hello! This is CS50. And we are Connor Harris (Harvard) and Stephen Krewson (Yale). This repo contains all the code we will use in our seminar: "Type-ing Music." You can get it by running the command:

> git clone git@github.com:StephenKrewson/cs50-music
> cd cs50-music

Euterpea is a domain-specific (i.e. it's for music!) embedded language built on top of Haskell, which is one of the best known and most advanced *functional* programming languages.

LilyPond offers a way to engrave sheet music using a musical (an)notation syntax that has similarities to the typesetting system TeX. 

## Requirements

- Haskell
We recommend installing the latest version of the Haskell Platform (here)[https://www.haskell.org/downloads#platform]. Then run:

> cabal install update-cabal
> cabal update

This will ensure that you have the latest version of everything before installing the Euterpea and Turtle packages.
